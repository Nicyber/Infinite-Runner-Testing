Definitely my first time doing any of this

Basically, look for the .exe file and double click on that, and it should open up your terminal and run the game from there.

In the game, your objective is to collect triforce shards, and avoid the bubbles (flaming skulls).

You can only jump by pressing (or holding) the spacebar. 

For some reason, the game only "updates" to the next frame, (i.e. advancing all of the sprites on screen to their next position) when you move the mouse cursor around in circles on the game window screen. Or otherwise type random keys, but moving the mouse works easiest for me. 

I don't know if this is the case if it is run on another computer, or if it's just mine, since an earlier game of mine had a similar issue of not updating to the next frame unless there was some sort of imput detected. 

Finally, if an error pops up when you close the window of the game when you're done playing, just click the "ignore" button. I am not sure what causes that to happen. 

Anyway have fun and may the goddess Hylia watch over you.
